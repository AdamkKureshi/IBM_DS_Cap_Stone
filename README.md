# IBM_DS_Cap_Stone
This is the capstone project for the IBM data science specialization. This project is part of the IBM Data Science Capstone Project (Coursera), focused on analyzing historical data of SpaceX Falcon 9 launches to predict the likelihood of the first stage successfully landing.

# Project Objectives
1. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Falcon 9 mission data
2. Visualize geospatial launch data using Folium
3. Build interactive dashboards using Plotly Dash
4. Train multiple machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN)
5. Identify the best-performing model for landing prediction
